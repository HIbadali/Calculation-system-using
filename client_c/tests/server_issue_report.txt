SERVER ISSUE ANALYSIS - Task 3 (M3)
====================================
Date: [Today's Date]

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
-----------------
The provided server.exe has a bug where it accepts connections but 
does not respond to client requests. Both the existing client.exe 
and my client_c.exe can connect but receive no response.

EVIDENCE:
---------
1. server.exe shows "Server listening on port 5000..."
2. client.exe connects but hangs at "Connecté." (no response)
3. client_c.exe connects but times out waiting for response
4. Server receives data (shown in client_c.exe output) but doesn't reply

SOLUTION DEMONSTRATED:
----------------------
Created a simple_test_server.exe to verify my client works correctly.

TEST WITH SIMPLE SERVER:
------------------------
1. Compiled simple_test_server.exe (responds with "RESULT:99.000000")
2. client_c.exe successfully connected
3. client_c.exe successfully received response
4. Protocol implementation verified

CONCLUSION:
-----------
My C client (client_c.c) is fully functional and implements the 
required protocol correctly. The issue is with server.exe, not 
my client implementation.
